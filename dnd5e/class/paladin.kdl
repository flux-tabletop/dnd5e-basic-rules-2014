		/* Divine Smite
			Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

			NOTE: This is essentially a custom spell whose level scales according to the spell slot used, and whose activation is "Special" (when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack). This works similarly to how one "uses" a spell stored in a scroll or gem, or from a feature.
