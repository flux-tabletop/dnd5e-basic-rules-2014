condition name="Sanctuary" {
	description "Any creature who targets you with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is provided by the action that granted this condition). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If you make an attack, cast a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this condition ends."
